# HOPE - A Hospital Management System

HOPE; our name says it all. With our project, we aim to simplify the user experience while booking appointments with doctors, or to donate blood or organs. This project works on a hospital management system, to sign up new patients and provide them the facilities for treatment or for donations. Doctors can register on our website through a form, which would then give them a unique doctor number in our hospital

## Front-End:
- HTML – For structuring the User Interfaces of the website.
- CSS – For styling the User Interfaces, Row-column layout and animation has also been implemented.
- JavaScript – For implementing the counter on the home page.

## Back-End:
- PHP – For connection to database, user authentication and form validation of Sign up form.
